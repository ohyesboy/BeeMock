00:00:03.54	Pumas are large,
00:00:07.24	cat-like animals which are found in America.
00:00:15.66	When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London,
00:00:18.03	they were not taken seriously.
00:00:19.58	However,
00:00:22.24	as the evidence began to accumulate,
00:00:26.39	experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate,
00:00:33.24	for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.
00:00:44.54	The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking strawberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her.
00:00:48.99	It immediately ran away when she saw it,
00:00:55.64	and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.
00:00:58.46	The search proved difficult,
00:01:07.41	for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening.
00:01:09.50	Wherever it went,
00:01:14.52	it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits.
00:01:21.42	Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes.
00:01:30.72	Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree.
00:01:36.37	The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma,
00:01:38.57	but where had it come from?
00:01:43.56	As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country,
00:01:51.09	this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape.
00:01:54.24	The hunt went on for several weeks,
00:01:56.91	but the puma was not caught.
00:02:05.03	It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.
